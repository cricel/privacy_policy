Privacy Policy

[DentiViz] ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data within our application on the Meta Quest platform.

1. No Collection of Personal Data
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. Our application operates entirely on the Meta Quest device without transmitting user data to external servers.

2. No Data Sharing with Third Parties
Since we do not collect any data, there is no sharing of personal or usage information with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

3. Device and Platform Data
Our app may rely on Meta’s platform services for essential functionality (e.g., cloud saves, multiplayer services, or leaderboard systems). Any data handled by Meta is subject to their own privacy policy, and we do not have access to or store this information.

4. Security and User Rights
Since we do not collect personal data, there is no need for user accounts, opt-out mechanisms, or data deletion requests. If you have concerns about privacy, we encourage you to review Meta’s privacy settings on your Quest device.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy if our app’s data practices change. Any modifications will be reflected in this document.
